Stretching from California to Washington, the Pacific Coast Highway, or PCH, is a highway of dreams. As you wind your way along the rugged cliffs, you'll be treated to breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean. Each curve in the road reveals a new panorama, from pristine beaches to majestic cliffs that plunge into the sea.

No Pacific Coast Highway journey is complete without experiencing the wonders of Big Sur. Towering redwoods, sheer cliffs, and hidden coves create a landscape that feels like a painting come to life. Take your time to explore McWay Falls, Bixby Creek Bridge, and Pfeiffer Beach – each a masterpiece in its own right.

### Quaint Coastal Towns
## Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey

Dotted along the highway are charming coastal towns like Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey. Explore the cobblestone streets of Carmel, known for its fairytale cottages and artistic vibe. In Monterey, visit the iconic Cannery Row and the renowned Monterey Bay Aquarium, a marine wonderland that captivates visitors of all ages.

## Highway 1 Cuisine
