Mont Saint-Michel dates back to the 8th century when the Bishop Aubert of Avranches had a vision to build a sanctuary on the rocky island. Over the centuries, the abbey evolved from a simple chapel to an awe-inspiring structure perched on the granite islet. The abbey's architecture reflects the different styles added during its prolonged construction, creating a captivating mosaic of Romanesque and Gothic influences.
